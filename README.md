### CHALLENGE

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.

* This can be applied to any of the difficulties.


### Solution

* Split the solution into two parts

* First part titled moderate() included both Easy and Moderate 

    * Created script to include ticker, the total volume of the stock, percentage and yearly change from when it opened and closed
    
    * Created conditional formatting that highlight positive change in green and negative change in red
    
* Second part titled hard() solved the hard part

    * Used for loop to determine greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume increase from the table we created in the second part
    
    * split up the solution into two parts mainly due to Excel constantly crashing
